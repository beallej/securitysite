        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>On Thursday, September 25th, security experts announced that bash, a piece of sofware installed on the majority of internet-using devices, had a bug. And not just any bug. This bug, cutely named Shellshock (or Bashdoor) was many times worse than Heartbleed, which gave us all a big fright earlier this year.<br>
And, like Heartbleed, this bug ain't nothing new; we have been vulnerable (and possibly exploited) for maybe even over twenty years. Because the bash developers didn't keep careful records, we don't now exactly when the bug was introduced, although developer Chet Ramey suspects he introduced it when implementing a new feature in 1992. And after the bug's introduction, whenever it was, the bug was not noticed, and so as bash was integrated into new software over the years, so was its vulnerability. <br> On September 12th, another developper, Stephane Chazelas, reached out to Ramey about a bug he had discovered in bash. Chazelas and Ramey quickly wrote a patch and started contacting software companies as fast as they could. They also contacted the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which rated the vulnerability a 10/10 on the badness scale-- severe, and easy to exploit.</p>
