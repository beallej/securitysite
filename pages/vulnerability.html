        <h2>So what's the big deal?</h2>
<p>Unlike Heartbleed, which only let the hackers view information, teh Shellshock vulnerability allows her/him to execute code, code that could, say, delete data, screw up your database, get at your files, run programs, etc. And, like, put malware on your computer. </p>
	<h2>What kinds of things are vulerable?</h2>
<p>Anything Linux/Unix based is vulnerable. This includes Linux, Mac, Android and iOS, as well as all of the Internet of Things devices that run on Linux/Unix in the background (so like most internet of things things). So not only is your computer vulnerable, but so are all of your smart devices. Perhaps even your car.<br>
However, that's not all. Most routers and web servers run on some sort of Unix-based OS. The hacker would then inherit any powers that the router or server posesses. </p>
<h2>Well I have PC? Does this mean I'm safe?</h2>
<p>Although PCs are safe in the sense that they do not run on Unix-based OSs, they are often connected to things that do. For example, most routers run on Linux, so they are vulerable. A hacker exploiting this vulnerablity could then hack into your network via the router and access any folders on your network.</p>
<h2>But like, they fixed it, right?</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271">patches available</a> for Unix and Linux. At this point, Apple still doesn't quite have its stuff together, although according to them, the general user isn't vulerable. It's only if you go and mess with some advanced Unix settings that you probably shouldn't be messing with anyway that you're vulnerable...according to apple (We tested Chet's computer and he's vulerable. hmm....).</p>
<h2>So am I vulnerable or not????</h2>
<p>To find out if your Mac/Linux computer is vulerable open up your command line and paste this line of code.:
<br><br>
curl https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh | bash
<br><br>
<?php
$output = shell_exec('curl https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh | bash');
echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
?>
If you get any <font color="red">VULERABLE</font>'s, you are vulnerable.</p>
