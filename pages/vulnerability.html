        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The shellshock vulnerability works kind of like a SQL injection. It  allows the hacker to to insert commands via the internet. The vulnerability lies in environment variable handling. After assigning a function to a variable, any code after the assignment is executed. What's more, no authentication is necessary. </p>
	<h2>What kinds of things are vulerable?</h2>
	<p>Anything Linux/Unix based is vulnerable. This includes Linux, Mac, Android and iOS, as well as all of the Internet of Things devices that run on Linux/Unix in the background (so like most internet of things things). So not only is your computer vulnerable, but so are all of your smart devices. Perhaps even your car.</p>
<h2>Well I have PC? Does this mean I'm safe?</h2>
<p>Although PCs are safe in the sense that they do not run on Unix-based OSs, they are often connected to things that do. For example, most routers run on Linux, so they are vulerable. A hacker exploiting this vulnerablity could then hack into your network via the router and access any folders on your network.</p>
<h2>But like, they fixed it, right?</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271">patches available</a> for Unix and Linux. At this point, Apple still doesn't quite have its stuff together, although according to them, the general user isn't vulerable. It's only if you go and mess with some advanced Unix settings that you probably shouldn't be messing with anyway that you're vulnerable...according to apple (We tested Chet's computer and he's vulerable. hmm....).</p>
<h2>So am I vulnerable or not????</h2>
<p>To find out if your Mac/Linux computer is vulerable open up your command line and paste this line of code.:

curl https://shellshocker.net/shellshock_test.sh | bash

If you get any <font color="red">VULERABLE</font>'s, you are vulnerable.</p>
