        <h2>Addressing the Scale of the Issue</h2>
        <p>First, before we get started, it should be made clear that it may be a while before this bug becomes irrelevant mostly because of the number of systems that use bash. Everything from some vehicle computers to web servers use bash in their operation, so the sheer magnitude of devices makes comprehensive patches virtually impossible until the newer systems simply replace the old ones that have been better patched. A good demonstrative example of this is shown below with respect to web servers:</p>
        <div class = "row text-center">
            <img src = "../img/graph.png"/>
        </div>
        <p><br>The most important information to glean from this graph is that <b>over 50%</b> of servers currently on the  are using Apache, which is Unix based and was immediately vulnerable following the disclosure of the bug. Most critical systems were going to get patched quickly anyway, but many web servers are not as well maintained, and will likely be vulnerable for a while to come.</p>
        <h2>What should I do?</h2>
        <p>Glad you asked. There are some things that you can do to prevent your own machine from being vulnerable. First, you should probably check whether your system (if you use a UNIX based operating system such as OSX or Linux) is vulnerable. This can be done by simply using the code that was used in <a href = "howitworks.html">our example</a> or more comprehensively (recommended) using the command given in the <a href = "vulnerability.html">Vulnerabilities section</a> to test your system.</p>
        <p>Then, given that there are some vulnerabilities on the system, you can patch the currently known flaws using the links below:</p>

        </div>
        <p><br>Now that you've fixed your system, there isn't much else to do. Hopefully now you understand the nature of the problem, and its associated dangers.</p>
